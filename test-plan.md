## Introduction
This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Bitzomax v3 video streaming platform, ensuring that all components work correctly before deployment. The platform consists of a Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend.

### Scope
- Backend API testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Frontend component and service testing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance and load testing

## Test Strategy

### Test Levels

#### Unit Testing
- **Backend:** JUnit 5 for testing individual classes and methods
- **Frontend:** Jasmine/Karma for testing Angular components and services

#### Integration Testing
- Tests to verify that different modules and services work correctly together
- API endpoint integration tests
- Service-to-repository integration tests

#### System Testing
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- UI functional tests

#### Performance Testing
- Load tests for video streaming capability
- API endpoint response time tests

### Test Types

#### Functional Testing
- Feature verification based on requirements
- User story validation
- Error handling and edge cases

#### Non-functional Testing
- Performance under load
- Security testing (authentication, authorization)
- Usability testing

## Test Environment

### Backend
- JDK 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- H2 in-memory database for testing
- Maven test configuration

### Frontend
- Node.js 18+
- Angular 16+
- Chrome for headless browser testing
- Karma/Jasmine test framework

### Test Data
- Mock video files and thumbnails
- Sample user accounts with different permission levels
- Seeded database with test data

### End-to-End Tests
- User registration flow
- Video upload and processing flow
- Video viewing with analytics
- Subscription purchase flow
- Admin management workflows

## Test Execution

### Test Preparation
1. Set up test environment
2. Configure test properties and databases
3. Create test data

### Test Execution Process
1. Run unit tests on every build
2. Run integration tests daily
3. Run end-to-end tests before releases
4. Perform manual verification of UI flows

### Automation
- Backend tests automated with JUnit and Maven
- Frontend tests automated with Karma/Jasmine
- End-to-end tests automated with Cypress
- CI/CD pipeline integration with GitHub Actions

## Defect Tracking
- Log all defects in the issue tracking system
- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results
- Add screenshots or videos when possible
- Assign severity and priority levels

### Defect Workflow
1. Reported
2. Triaged
3. Assigned
4. Fixed
5. Verified
6. Closed

## Test Reporting
- Daily test execution reports
- Defect summary reports
- Test coverage reports
- Performance test results

## Exit Criteria
- All critical and high-priority tests pass
- Code coverage meets targets (>80% for backend, >70% for frontend)
- No critical or high-severity defects remain open
- Performance meets specified targets
